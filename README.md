# Overview

This was a fun test program to learn the py arcade library. I have always enjoyed playing games, so why not make my own.

This game is a top-down puzzle game. You control a mouse with the WASD keys to run through mazes and solve puzzles. There are currently three levels. There are also two text buttons which allow you to reset the current level and quit the game
